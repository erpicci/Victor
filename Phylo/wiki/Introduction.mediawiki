== Phylo ==
The '''Phylo''' package allows building and manipulating phylogenetic trees and multiple sequence alignments. It relies on the ''Align2'' package, with which shares the modular object oriented design. This package is written in C++11 and follows the Strategy Pattern.

There are three main components in the packages are:
*'''DistanceMatrix''' - stores information about sequences and distances among them
*'''PhylogeneticTree''' - represents a phylogenetic tree, where leaves are sequences; there are two interchangeable types of trees: ''RootedTree'' and ''UnrootedTree''. It is possible to switch from the latter to the former transparently (the underling rooting techniques is the ''midpoint rooting''), or by manually specifying a root node. The Visitor Design Pattern is available for this tree hierarchy
*'''MultipleAlignment''' - a multiple sequence alignment

There are several strategies to construct each of the main components:
*'''DistanceMatrixBuilder''' - builds a '''DistanceMatrix''' from a set of sequences:
**''IdentityPercentage'' - estimates a distance as the percent identity after a global alignment
**''LevenshteinDistance'' - uses the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance Levenshtein distance] metrics
**''FengDolittleDistance'' - distance metrics proposed by Feng and Doolittle <ref>Feng, Da-Fei, Doolittle, RussellF. ''Progressive sequence alignment as a prerequisitet to correct phylogenetic trees''. Journal of Molecular Evolution, 1987, p. 351-360.</ref>
*'''ClusteringAlgorithm''': produces a '''PhylogeneticTree''' from a '''DistanceMatrix''':
**''UPGMA''
**''Fitch-Margoliash''
**''Neihbor Joining''
*'''MultipleAlignmentAlgorithm''' - produces a '''MultipleAlignment''' from a set of sequences:
**''Feng-Doolittle''
**''ClustalW''
